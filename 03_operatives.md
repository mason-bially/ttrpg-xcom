# Operatives

Player characters represent elite operatives (usually of the XCOM organization). Therefore they represent soldiers, engineers, and agents at the peak of their capability, learning from their experiences and training themselves to advance from it.

This is represented by an experience system.

### XP

Experience comes from successfully completing missions, or objectives on the way towards completing them. This primarily includes winning battles and subduing enemies. But can include interrogations, covert operations, and other actions.

### Rank

Operatives also have a rank ranging from 1 to 8. This is in part a recognition by XCOM of the operative's skill and the ability to command others. But this is also a milestone in the advancement of an operative and allows them the opertunity to increase their attributes and unlock more powerful abilities.

|Rank|XP|Name|
|---||---|
|1|-|Rookie|
|2|90|Squaddie|
|3|480|Corporal|
|4|700|Sergeant|
|5|925|Lieutenant|
|6|1380|Captain|
|7|1840|Major|
|8|2550|Colonel|

You can imagine that civilians are rank 0 or below. And while enemies may be listed by rank, they will sometimes be listed with a negative rank to represent their comparative lack of training and general lack of ability.

You can of course continue beyond rank 8. But by rank 8 most reasonable threats should be no match for a squad of XCOM operatives.

### Paths

Operatives have three paths that they follow. Each path includes a list of relevant abilities and rank specific bonuses (usually improvements to attributes or sometimes free abilities).

While an operative can purchase any ability, the only pay the normal price for ones from their paths. Other abilities will cost the operative anywhere from 50% to 200% more. As abilities often have a series of requirements this represents a significant investment for many abilities.

When creating a character operatives will pick three paths. The species the operative chose may provide them access to additional paths.

If a path provide an ability for free that you paid for then you receive the XP you paid for it as a refund.

If two (or more) paths provide an ability for free you may choose one of the paths and use the XP you would have paid for the ability (as if it were a path ability) as a "discount" for an ability on that path.

#### Proficiencies

Proficiencies are a group of abilities which provide the ability to use weapons, armor, and tools. The effects for not having these differ:

* Weapons: Using a weapon in which you are not proficient can not crit, all hits automatically count as grazes, hits that would graze instead miss. Pistols are an exception and instead do -1 damage (they still can't crit and dodges still count as grazes).
* Armor: Using armor in which you are not proficient halves your mobility and reduces the armor it provides by 1 (minimum 1).
* Equipment: Using equipment with which you are not proficient is effectively impossible.
