# Operatives

When XCOM integrated society they created new task forces through the world consiting of operatives. The best of the availble, these operatives were tasked with the same mission XCOM had always had, their motto again interpreted to fit the current times. **Vigilo, Confido—I am watchful, I am relied upon**.

That mission was still watching for existential threats, but now they came from the populace. That mission was still being the last line of defense against those threats, but now more stategically offensive than ever before. These tasks forces were sent out with that mission in mind, cobbled togeather from what was at hand and thrust into that mission.

XCOM operatives have traditionally followed paths in their training as dictated by the doctrine of the age. Specialized for specific equipment and training abilities at the edge of human capaility. New paths would have to be forged in this new age.

### XP

Player characters represent soldiers, engineers, and agents at the peak of their capability, learning from their experiences and training themselves to advance from it. This is represented by an experience system.

Experience comes from successfully completing missions, or objectives on the way towards completing them. This primarily includes winning battles and subduing enemies. But can include interrogations, covert operations, and other actions.

### Rank

Operatives also have a rank ranging from 1 to 8. This is in part a recognition by XCOM of the operative's skill and the ability to command others. But this is also a milestone in the advancement of an operative and allows them the opertunity to increase their attributes and unlock more powerful abilities.

|Rank|XP|Name|
|---||---|
|1|-|Rookie|
|2|90|Squaddie|
|3|480|Corporal|
|4|700|Sergeant|
|5|925|Lieutenant|
|6|1380|Captain|
|7|1840|Major|
|8|2550|Colonel|

You can imagine that civilians are rank 0 or below. And while enemies may be listed by rank, they will sometimes be listed with a negative rank to represent their comparative lack of training and general lack of ability.

You can of course continue beyond rank 8. But by rank 8 most reasonable threats should be no match for a squad of XCOM operatives.

### Paths

Operatives have three paths that they follow. Each path includes a list ranks. At each rank a list of abilities that the operative may now train is listed, along with the stat increases to the maximum value that the operative can attain (training is required to realize these gains).

While an operative can purchase any ability, they only pay the normal price for ones from their paths. Other abilities will cost the operative anywhere from 50% to 300% more. As abilities often have a series of requirements this represents a significant investment for many abilities. Some abilities—psi and species specific ones especially—can only be taken if you have the relevant path.

If you take an abilitity that is later on your path you are refunded the difference upon achieving that rank. This allows a character to specialize deep in a path if they wish.

When creating a character operatives will pick three paths. The species the operative chose may provide them access to additional paths.

#### Proficiencies

Proficiencies are a group of abilities which provide the ability to use weapons, armor, and tools. The effects for not having these differ:

* Weapons: Using a weapon in which you are not proficient can not crit, all hits automatically count as grazes, hits that would graze instead miss. Pistols are an exception and instead do -1 damage (they still can't crit and dodges still count as misses).
* Armor: Using armor in which you are not proficient halves your mobility and reduces the armor it provides by 1 (minimum 1).
* Equipment: Using equipment with which you are not proficient is effectively impossible.
