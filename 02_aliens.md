# Aliens

This is a game about aliens.

## Humanoid Species

The Ethereals have modified their humanoid servants for a long time. During and after the invasion of Earth many of them were modified with human DNA to better survive the planet. 

The primary option for player characters are a humanoid hybrids, usually ones that range from 100% to 25% human. In general 0% human, full aliens, are not playable, they have been modified out of existence (though this may not always be entirely Lore Accurate, vis-a-vis vipers) in the years following the original invasion by the Ethereal Gene Modding programs. Their stat modifications are presented only for completeness.

The standard starting stats for all humanoid based characters are:

* 8 Health
* 12 Mobility
* 60 Aim
* 50 Will
* 40 Tech

This is based on the assumption that characters are at peak fitness for their species, and are middle aged. For older characters reduce Aim by up to 30 and increase Tech and Will (at a 2:1 ratio; that is a much older character would be 30 Aim, 60 Will, 60 Tech) the corresponding amount.

### Human

Humans are the most populous species on Earth, and the most adapted to live on the planet. Unlike the alien races that invaded Earth Humans have not been entirely specialized by Ethereals, hence they represent the most diverse range of possible attributes, but they also do not have access to any special abilities or attributes by default.

Humans are one of the only species that have access to Psionics as a Rank feature (must be 75% human).

Due to the gene therapy experiments of the Ethereals humans are the most common template for hybridization. For each 25% a character is human they may choose one of the following bonuses:

* +3 Aim, +4 Tech
* +3 Aim, +4 Will
* +4 Will, +4 Tech
* +8 Aim (50% human or better)
* +9 Will (50% human or better)
* +9 Tech (50% human or better)
* +1 Health (75% human or better)
* +1 Mobility (75% human or better)
* +4 Aim, +5 Will, +5 Tech (100% human)
* +10 Psi (100% human)
