# Aliens

This is a game about aliens.

## Species

The Ethereals have modified their servants for a long time. During and after the invasion of Earth many of them were modified with human DNA to better survive the planet. 

The primary option for player characters are a genetic hybrids, usually one that ranges from 100% to 25% human. In general 100% non-human aliens are not playable, they have been modified out of existence (though this may not always be entirely Lore Accurate, vis-a-vis vipers), and were effectively wiped out in the years following the original invasion. Their stat modifications are presented only for completeness.

The standard starting stats for all genetically based characters are:

* 8 Health
* 12 Mobility
* 60 Aim
* 50 Will
* 40 Tech

### Human

Humans are the most populous species on Earth, and the most adapted to live on the planet. Unlike the alien races that invaded Earth Humans have not been entirely specialized by Ethereals, hence they represent the most diverse range of possible attributes, but they also do not have access to any special abilities or attributes by default.

Humans are one of the only species that have access to Psionics as a Rank feature (must be 75% human).

Due to the gene therapy experiments of the Ethereals humans are the most common template for hybridization. For each 25% a character is human they may choose one of the following bonuses:

* +3 Aim, +3 Tech
* +3 Aim, +3 Will
* +3 Will, +3 Tech
* +7 Aim (50% human or better)
* +7 Will (50% human or better)
* +7 Tech (50% human or better)
* +1 Health (75% human or better)
* +1 Mobility (75% human or better)
* +3 Aim, +3 Will, +3 Tech (100% human)
* +10 Psi (100% human)
