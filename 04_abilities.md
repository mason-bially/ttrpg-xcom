# Abilities

### Combat Utility

#### Medic

Requires: ?? XP

Your stablize checks always succeed.

+20 Tech for the use of combat & emergency medical equipment.

#### Field Medic

Requires: Path Only, Medic, ?? XP

+10 Tech (30 total) for the use of combat & emergency medical equipment.

+30 Crit for combat medical checks (stablize and emergency medical equipment checks). On a successful crit apply 1 healing.

All emergency medical equipment provides +2 healing.

Increase the healing provided by both of these abilities by +1 for the following talents:
* Doctor
* Surgeon
* Field Pathologist

### General

#### Psiwalled Mind

Requires: Path Only, Psimatician, ?? XP

Due to your knowledge of psionics your mind is protected as best as possible for a non-psionic individual. +15 Will for the purpose of calculating your psionic defense (does not stack with other sources, choose best).

### Overview Abilities

#### Dedicated

Requires: ?? XP

You may roll a Will check each day, on success instead perform two bonus activities. They cannot both be training actions (nor may others be duplicated at the GM's discretion).

#### Pathologist

Requires: ?? XP

For your bonus activity you may autopsy corpses to learn relevant information about they died along with a rough outline of any cybernetic, genetic, or psionic enhancements they may have had.

May provide certain research choices when given enough relevant corpses.

#### Field Pathologist

Requires: Path Only, Pathologist, ?? XP

You may perform autopsies in the field. This takes approximetly 5 minutes per question you wish answered.

Additionally, you may collect Samples in one Final Action (normal time 1 minute), and remove most cybernetics in four Final Actions (normal time 10 minutes) taken in sequence.

#### Xenobiologist, Eleriumologist, Psimatician

Requires: ?? XP

You no longer suffer research penalties (normally half speed and -40 Tech) for the related research tasks. Which are in general those that are beyond normal human knowledge: alien biology, alien technology, and psionics.

#### Nurse

Requires: ?? XP

You may use each bonus activity to attempt to increase the recovery of another character. Roll a Tech check, on success advance recovery by an additional day. Alternitvely you may use your primary activity to do this for 5 characters (roll once). In either case, regardless of if the check is successful or not the characters count as being nursed.

#### Doctor

Requires: ?? XP

As a primary action you may increase the recovery of up to 20 nursed characters by one, if you do roll a Tech-20 check, on success double all recovery increases applied to one (nursed) character (including the bonus inherent in this ability, and the nurse check if it was successful).

#### Surgeon

Requires: ?? XP

You may perform surgery as a multi-day primary activity. This is a Tech check, on failure the character is injured for 2 points of health (unless they succeed a Defense-20 check), after the required successes the surgery is complete. Surgery can only be done on healthy characters and may be stopped after any roll, however they must recover before attempting surgery again (and all progress is lost).

In general surgery is done to attempt to correct permanent injuries suffered by characters.

Modifers:
* +10 for doctor
* -10 for non-human physiology unless a xenobiologist

+5 Tech on any medical research checks.

#### Cyberneticist

Requires: ?? XP

You may install or uninstall cybernetics on other characters as a multi-day primary activity. See the relevant cybernetic for the relevant stats (tech modifier, damage for failure, number of rolls, defense of cybernetic). This is a Tech check that, on failure, the character either suffers the listed injury (unless they succeed a Defense-30 check), or the cybernetic is destroyed unless it succeeds its defense check. This can only be done on healthy characters, and may be stopped after any roll by rolling a cybernetics defense check, however characters must recover before attempting again (and all progress is lost).

Modifers:
* +10 for Doctor
* +20 from Surgeon
* -10 for non-human physiology unless a Xenobiologist
* +5 from Eleriumologist
* +15 from Psimatician if it is a psionic cybernetic

+5 Tech on any cybernetic research checks.
