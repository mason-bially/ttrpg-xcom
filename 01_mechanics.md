This table top roleplaying game is a d100 system. Meaning when there is an action to resolve that has a chance of failing we randomly determine a number between 1 and a 100 and then compare that to our character's ability and the relevant modifiers. We generate this number by rolling two ten sided dice with different marks for the 10s and 1s positions.

To preform a check we first find the relevant character attribute and set that as our **base target value**. For example if we were trying to hack a MEC we would use our Tech attribute. Then, depending on the situation, we apply bonuses and maluses to it, modifiers that add or subtract from the base target value to create our **target value**. For example shooting at another character in cover will apply a cover malus that lowers the target value, making it more difficult. Finally we roll a number and if we are equal to or under the target value we succeed.

#### Damage Rolls

Besides using d10s and d100s for randomization there is only one other relevant role. And that is the damage roll, which generally uses a d12 and sometimes a d10. Depending on the weapon's damage range we divide resulting roll of the d12 and round up to the nearest whole number (unless it exactly divides, for example 3 divided by 3 is 1). See the table below.

|Damage Range|Dice|Divide By|
|---|---|---|
|2|d10/d12|5/6|
|3|d12|4|
|4|d12|3|
|5|d10|2|
|6|d12|2|

## Attributes

Characters - player and enemy alike - have attributes. These are the core stats which inform what a character can do.

Some attributes every character has, like **health**, others only some characters have, like **psi**. Attributes that aren't listed for a character can be assumed to be 0.

There are four attributes that are most commonly rolled as checks:

* **Aim** - The ability to coordinate one's actions. Primarily used for aiming weapons.
* **Will** - The ability to exert one's will. Primarily used for social situations and protecting against psionics.
* **Tech** - The ability to perform technical tasks. Primarily used for hacking technology and performing specialized tasks.
* **Psi** - For those with psionics, the ability to project that power.

The other attributes, explained briefly are:

* **Health** - The amount of physical damage one can withstand. Describes both the maximum health and the current health. Cannot be checked.
* **Mobility** - The amount of distance one can cover. Describes the number of tiles a character can move in an action. Cannot be checked.
* **Defense** - The innate protection one has available. A defensive modifier (a malus against other character's checks). Sometimes checked for withstanding extreme damage.
* **Dodge** - The ability to react quickly to danger. Primarily used in reaction to attacks to reduce the damage of incoming fire. Sometimes checked for reactions.
* **Crit** - The ability to hit just the right spot. Primarily used in combat as a chance to increase damage. Sometimes checked for luck.
* **Armor** - The innate amount of damage reduction. Cannot be checked.

There are many ways to modify these attributes. Equipment often modifies these attributes for most combat situations, for example a laser sight increases the Crit attribute when firing *that weapon*. The point here is that most characters will have 0 Dodge and 0 Crit outside of combat situations - even if they have the armor on - because those bonuses are granted by equipment that only applies to combat.
