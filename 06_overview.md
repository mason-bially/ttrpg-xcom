# Overview

The overall state of the XCOM mission is represented by an overview map. This can be a World map (for "classic" XCOM), Regional map (for a resistance cell), or City map (for post war peacekeeping).

In general this map consists of the following information which the GM should track:

* Regions
  * With an individual threat rating.
  * A series of hidden notes about what is going on there.
* A world threat rating.
* The primary XCOM asset(s) and their locations
  * Where the players live and begin missions from.
  * With a stockpile of resources.
  * And facilities with staff.

This system is rather open ended to support a variety of potential play styles. However in general we will be assuming a city level map.

The squad of player characters will likely start at a low rank, which means their control over the overall strategy of XCOM and their choice in missions will be relatively limited. They will often be given an overarching task and a pool of resources within which they will be expected to achieve those goals.

XCOM is not a pretty or trusting organization. The squad will be expected to find creative solutions to their resource problems. Selling corpses and evidence for cash, using evidence and corpses as raw materials, "interrogating" captured agents, and so on are all well within the XCOM playbook (though there may be repercussions to consider). The squad will also have to work through their own technical issues, they will not always be given the weaponry or intelligence they might want (or need) to solve problems, they will have to work it out for themselves.

These ideas will work well for any variant of play, from war footing XCOM to peacekeeping XCOM, to non-XCOM mercenary bands, or even Alien based campaigns with some tweaks.

### Roleplay

The point of the overview is for the creation of cooperative "planning" sessions that can also involve cross purposes for character tension.

Consider that the stockpile of resources available to the squad will be limited, as well how much time they have (though they won't always know how long till they get interrupted). The players can use this opportunity to have their characters argue with each other, work together to compromise, and so on. This is meant to be an opportunity for narrative exploration around a puzzle.

### Mechanics

The basic mechanics are relatively straight forward. The overview advances one day at a time. There are various tasks that characters can perform to advance given priorities, some of these tasks cost resources. Characters will roll once each day and either succeed (reducing the time required, or achieving some (maybe hidden) special outcome, and maybe triggering abilities) or fail (nothing happens). This is usually a Tech check, but some use other attributes (often Will).

The GM will be keeping track of events throughout the world and on some days there will be situations to respond to (often having to pick an option) which should trigger a discussion. Discussions will also often happen after a mission when choosing how to strategize, or after a task is complete and resources need to be reallocated.

Most situations that are triggered will be combat missions with a scene relating it to the overarching goal of the squad. But sometimes they will be interactions with non-player characters (social situations), often depending on who was doing which tasks. It's important to make sure players don't get bored, inviting other players into the conversation is one solution, and keeping the scenes short another.
