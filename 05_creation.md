Games can either start at Rank 1 which is true to the "classic" XCOM experience of starting off with no abilities and having to face aliens anyway. Or they can start at Rank 3, with exactly enough experience to reach it, and the rank 3 training not completed. This is more akin to a classic TTRPG starting condition.

Steps to making a character:

1. Decide on a concept.
2. Pick a species.
3. Pick 3 Paths.
4. Spend initial experience (Rank 1 Characters don't start with experience).

Some of these path groups are from war times and are hence heavily biased towards combat.

# Example Characters

These characters are from XCOM CS and are an attempt at more balanced abilities and playable characters.
